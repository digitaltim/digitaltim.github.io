Back to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS is a utility first CSS framework.").

I went through the Tailwind CSS Tutorial Series[^1]. I started following along and completed it. I then did a second pass through it for my current project and created a page that slightly modified the base concepts learned and made it more my own. I tried to systematically break down each video in terms of the steps that it took and how I'd go about applying them again in the future. It was good to learn but I need to get back to the meat of my project.
