I've decided to pivot on a project for work and go the Laravel Jetstream Interia Tailwind route... Prior to this I built a prototype UI using BootstrapVue components. It looked nice but wasn't connected to a backend. So in the process of researching my full stack, I started valuing the idea of making something that's maintainable and building into the structure/documentation the idea of migrating the code to newer releases when they become available. This is a bigger picture topic, but for today I want to focus on the piece I'm working on: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS is a utility first CSS framework.").

Some time has passed since I started to evaluate this stack and I realize the next hurdle in this process is the UI. BootstrapVue[^1] sort of falsely gave me a sense of UI design prowess. I was able to build out a prototype that worked and was sufficiently complex. Yet as soon as I wanted to change things, I felt hindered. I'm going to try to take a step back and learn UI layout somewhat from scratch. I have some design ideas that I'd like to explore but don't really know how to start and would prefer to develop a systematic approach to using a tool versus hacking someone else's design as a starting point.

The interesting part is there's value in starting off with someone else's design. Making small changes, or extending the pattern implemented can yield a strong positive encouraging experience. Yet it can also lead to frustration when more drastic changes are required because the initial design is based on the data they needed to display for their needs. Thus I'm thinking there are a couple phases at play here. First phase, test to make sure the structure of the stack makes sense and works. Second phase, tear it down and build it back up using the fundamentals.

I should note here that my typical workflow used to involve watching people code using video tutorials and following along. This proved useful to "experience progress" at first. But I recently made the switch from a tutorial/article style of learning to the official documentation. Thus this journey might not be suitable for everyone depending on their comfort level. These are really my notes for me to use as a reference.
