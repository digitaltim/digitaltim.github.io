title: "Git For Everything Except Microsoft Word Documents"

I was searching for quick confirmation that adding Microsoft Word documents to version control wouldn't actually track text changes because the contents would be considered a binary blob. Thus the most useful feature, seeing what's changed between versions, would be missing if I add this document that I've been working on to an existing Git repo... Yet I came across an interesting article that shows there are some solutions but not ones I'll likely explore anytime soon.[^1]

This prompted some deeper thoughts...

- It would be fun to create a Todo app using Git. The Todo app comes up in my searches for programming tutorials often enough that it stands out. I think Arthur is talking about scraping GitHub issues as a basis for software development project management. I'm moreso referring to using Git as a datastore of sorts, instead of a database to hold the list of todo items... This is just an inkling of a thought so I'd need to think it through further...

- Now that GitHub is owned by Microsoft, it only seems natural that they'd somehow merge revision control into their productivity suite of software... Also, not entirely sure what this looks like. For example is it more consumer or developer focussed... Either way, seems like that will be coming in the future...
