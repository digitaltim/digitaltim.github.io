I (re)started [P90X3](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/programs/p90x3/start-here "If you have 30 minutes a day, you can get totally ripped.") today. I tried starting last week but ended up getting sick and needed to hold off. A little bit of background, I've been doing these workouts for a while now but haven't followed the program yet. This is my first attempt to complete the 90 day routine... I should try to do some before and after stats. What I can say is that last week I took notes during the workout. I ended up going too light with the weight choices and kept everything at 8 pounds. This week I bumped it up to 12 pounds except for the last exercise I went down to 5. More stats to come!
