Day 3 of [P90X3](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/programs/p90x3/start-here "If you have 30 minutes a day, you can get totally ripped."). I haven't done the workout yet! However, I'm definitely going to... I wanted to post this because I'm feeling super stiff and sore today. I'm also feeling pretty excited about today's Yoga! I need it. I feel like maybe in the past I didn't quite get the right results since I was skipping days like today. Whereas I think it's probably pretty important for recovery. We'll see. I do feel like I've somewhat gotten stronger overall. It seems like there's a sort of self propelling machine effect where getting stronger creates additional motivation to keep going. We'll see!
