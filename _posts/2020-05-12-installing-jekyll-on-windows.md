I've decided that I like this blogging tool so far... As such I need to get some tooling in place to make changes. If I were working with pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript I could use the live server plugin in VS Code. But because Jekyll needs to convert the Markdown into HTML, it's probably better to get it setup locally... Otherwise I'd have to comit to GitHub to see my changes... Following the default instructions.[^1] I see though there's another option on Windows using WSL. I'm going to punt on that right now for the sake of simplicity... 

    jekyll -v
    jekyll 4.0.1

Success!
