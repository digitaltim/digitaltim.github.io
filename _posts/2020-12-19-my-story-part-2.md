It's my story. I've got to tell it.

My memory doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. Yet it has to be about four years, maybe five, since I came across The Primal Wound[^1]. This book transformed the way I see myself and life. It's provided the most accurate lens through which I can explain my experience. It's really set the stage for me to look at the world through the lens of abandonment.

Coming Home to Self[^2] is the follow up book to help those struggling with abandonment to heal the past. I pulled this book off of my shelf this morning because I think I'm ready. I hope I'm ready. As tears well up in my eyes, I don't fully know if I am. But I do know the pain is right there beneath the surface. So clear yet so hidden. I'm hoping that I can use the remaining vacation time and days off from the coming holidays to dive into this book and summarize how it applies to me.

I feel like some context is in order yet as I start to cry I don't want to share. I can feel the pain so close now. It's streaming down my face. Why can't I access this when I want to? Why in therapy am I so detached from this obvious source of pain? Why does it manifest in all aspects of my daily existence, contaminating the normal and hijacking anything resembling a trigger.

I know the answers. Yet I don't feel them. There is a place in my brain that feels this reality. Yet it's detached, protected and hidden from my everyday conscious expereience. I want to begin the process of integration. I want to become whole. I'm tired of having the days of my life repeat this pattern of fear driven living. I want to trust in God and believe there's a bigger plan in play. I want to be empowered by my story. Not debilitated when I touch it.

There's so much emotional energy behind the last few paragraphs. It's hard to deliniate when "logical Tim" is speaking versus "emotional Tim". Yet it's there. I become the emotion. This is special. Because for the most part, my waking self is an attempt to avoid the emotion and control the outcome. Yet it's been my experience that the emotion always wins. However, I have yet to accept this and am only recently realizing that I need to make space for this emotional self that needs extra patience and gentleness at times. My typical response to my complex emotions is to try to rationalize them through journaling, which ends up kind of being a reset/reality check, and generally gets me back to a baseline understanding of what's going on.

I can generally summarize any complex feeling by saying: "I must be fearing abandonment right now". Yet this is logical. Even when I go into the details and tease out what happened, I still am left with a disconnect between my emotional experience and a logical construct to describe it. These lenses/perspectives seem to sit in opposition on either side of the same room. They don't appear to be integrated. But remain disintegrated.

So without too much additional detail, I'm going to try to attempt to master the language of my experience. I'm going to attempt to knowingly enter into the state of pain by relating to the words written. I believe reading these books gives me access to the pain. It's really hard to describe, but the best way I can approach it is that I don't want to read it. In fact I've tried in the past to form small groups and end up finding that most people can't easily jump in and go deep. There's a resistence to doing so that's inherent in our design. A wall that's put up to protect us or protect the trauma from being exposed for what we are. Yet light must shine into the darkness. Else I'll be consumed by it.
