I was tasked with a project to understand how an internal tool is generating the results displayed to the user. I was given a design specifcation document created by another developer several years ago. The goal was to confirm the source code behaved in a way consistent with the specification document and where they differ to update the document to reflect what the code is actually doing. I was able to do this but in the process uncovered inconsistencies and complexity whose origin was unclear. In discussing next steps it was suggested to create a matrix of common variables used across domains of functionality. This was strange to me at first because I was accustomed to approaching this from a systematic top down perspective. Yet upon further thought, a matrix of important variables might be a better approach to bring stake holders up to speed and aid in my understanding of the system level design.

As such my first step is to do a little research. I find this helpful to set the stage/context for my efforts and help clarify what the expected results will be. I'm satisfied that I did because I can see more clearly the value of this approach. Although the referece isn't an exact match, the high level benefits driving the effort make sense. Mainly that any future development/enhancements will be better understood and chosen because of the efforts to abstract concepts/complexity in a more accessible way.[^1]
