title: "Keep It Simple"

I figured out yesterday, although I was trying to keep things simple, I was actually complicating my approach by having too many moving pieces at once. I found myself on several learning curves and needed to limit it to one if possible. Vue.js is great but a little complex. I needed to focus on learning it instead of getting stuck in the weeds trying to implement a complex project with it. CodePen is a great way to test out the basics of Vue.js and reinforce fundamental concepts.[^1]

I also was curious about the premium features offered and wondered how much I could get done using the free version.[^2] There are a lot of cool features. I immediately thought this might be a good way to build rapid private prototypes for work because it has the flexibility to run demos and share with others for receiving feedback. I spoke with a colleague and they thought it might be overkill for our needs since we have on prem servers. Yet I quickly realized this can be a trap. Sure I can move code over to our dev resources, but I still have to configure them if I want to do anything other than what they are setup to do. Even adding a new site requires that I modify the Apache settings. It's an extra step that I don't have to worry about with CodePen. Lastly, we tried to work on a pen together and ran into some challenges. The Collab Mode would have been nice. I would have paid $8 to have that be a smoother process.[^3]

Anyway... I'm not fully convinced. So I'll continue to use it on my own to see if I can build up a use case to ask for this resource. Yet I still want to keep things simple but not reject effective steps for the sake of simplicity only to end up short sighted. As with most things, finding the right kind of balance is key. Here's a quick pen I put together to get familiar with directives conditional, loops and bindings... It's not fully working since it requires clicking the checkbox twice to get the additional output to show. At least with CodePen I can focus on learning Vue.js instead of all the tooling setup, etc. that can complicate the process.
