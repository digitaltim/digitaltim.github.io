I wanted a place to stash technical tidbits I come across. Found this sitting in my repo. Seems like a good place to start to at least capture some content. Read back through [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ "A step-by-step beginner's guide to creating a personal website and blog using Jekyll and hosting it for free using GitHub Pages."). Seems like an easy way to create a simple yet flexible static site quickly and easily.
