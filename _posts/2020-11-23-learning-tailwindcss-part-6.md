Back to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS is a utility first CSS framework.").

I found a good video on using Tailwind CSS with CSS Grid[^1]. Yet I also realize that I still don't have a solid understanding of how to organize information on the screen using Tailwind. Thus I've decided to survery this series and see how The Net Ninja does it. I often experience resistence to starting from scratch and putting the time into learning in this way. Yet I always come away from the time spent with a deeper understanding and better appreciation for the fundamentals.

I could easily go into detail on each one the the videos in the series. Yet what I need to learn is how to approach the visual layout and the interplay between the elements and the rest of the page. I can easily get overwhelmed by this process because it's very subjective. Thus, it's not quite the same as backend work, where say following the Laravel approach and using the artisan tool to scaffold a project creates a lot of structure. With the frontend design it's much more free form and yet there's a way to structure things by looking at the content the page should contain and how it get's arranged.

Yet the biggest challenge for me is what constitutes a "working" version. This is something I hope to become more comfortable with over time. But with anything, I need to practice. So I'm hoping to get a little bit of guidance with this Tailwind CSS Tutorial series[^2]. I'm about halfway through the series and what stands out the most is how to kind of play with Tailwind overall through some customization. I think I'd try to use the out of the box configuration versus trying to customize the base. One less thing to worry about. However, just seeing how easy it is through the tutorial series helps plant seeds for future usage scenarios and acts as a reference for future use.

The final thing I'll touch on is that I generally feel like I clutch too tightly to the design I'm referencing. I suppose this exposes the weakness in my understanding. Yet I also think there are general layout "types" that I have yet to master. I would just say that maybe it's one thing to copy someone's design and make it work with my content. It's entirely another thing to come up with my own totally new design. I often find that I feel this pressure to come up with my own design when I really just need to make content work in an existing one. So interesting... This pattern of "over complicating" the problem can be crippling for me. Need to take small steps.

Overall I'm still surprised how dramatic the look and feel changes with what seems like a minimal amount of utility classes applied. It almost feels like there's no good reason to not have a minimal amount of styling with how accessible this CSS framework seems... The devil is in the details I suppose... It's always easier when someone else is doing it for you...

To wrap up, I think the temptation I have is to move forward and try to learn more. Yet I sense this course has enough of the basics to allow me to start applying aspects of each to my own projects. That's going to be the challenging part. Taking what's been done in the course and applying it in a slightly different way to have the experience I'm looking to give to users.
