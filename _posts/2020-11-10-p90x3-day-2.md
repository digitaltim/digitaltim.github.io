Day 2 of [P90X3](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/programs/p90x3/start-here "If you have 30 minutes a day, you can get totally ripped."). There were no weights today. Just cardio. It was harder. I need to add in my workout stats from the heart rate monitor I use. What I can say for certain is that I love it! I admire people who have enough experience where they can hit the gym and get a good workout without too much preparation. For me, I need a plan. If I make the plan it tends to be the same routine. With P90X3, I end up being pushed to do/learn new things and work harder as I adapt and learn.

As I said in the first post, I've been picking and choosing classes from this series for a little while on and off. Yet now I really want to stick to the program to see if I can actually finish it! The past several weeks I backed off completely and cycled through only Yoga, Dynamix and Pilates. These each sort of strengthened me in newish ways that I think helps to balance me out from all the repetition I've done over time. Pilates for sure challenged me. Breath and movement. Yoga was old hat and Dyanmix felt like it was working all the muscles I don't usually use.
