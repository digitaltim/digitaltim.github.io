Day 4 of [P90X3](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/programs/p90x3/start-here "If you have 30 minutes a day, you can get totally ripped."). I barely squeezed yesterday's workout in... Started at 9:30 PM! Luckily it was Yoga, but man I was sore and am even more sore today. I had to take a ibuprofen this morning so I wouldn't feel so stiff moving around. I still feel pretty sore though... I'm excited for today's workout. Even though I'm sore, I'll be able to do the workout at lunch. This makes it much easier to fit into the schedule for the day. I might need to reconsider Wednesday lunch hikes to do the P90X3 instead just to make things easier. Overall I love it, I just wish my appetite didn't go into overdrive as well. This is the most counter productive aspect of working out hard.
