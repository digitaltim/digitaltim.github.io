Back to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS is a utility first CSS framework.").

Man this CSS framework is cool. I suppose so it CSS itself. Though I've never really learned it from scratch, so there's a bit of novelty with Tailwind that might not be there if I were building lots of projects with raw CSS. I'd probably be more like: Oh, this is how Tailwind leverages this CSS feature, interesting... Let's get into it starting with Flexbox!

Flex Direction[^1] seems like a nice way to reorder elements. Not going to link every other section because it doesn't seem useful... Flex Wrap seems useful when the parent is flex. Flex is a little confusing with the grow/shrinking of content. Flex Grow specifically turns grow on or off. Flex Shrink turns shrink on or off. Finally Order does just that!

I'm moving into Grid land next, but realizing that I might just want to move a little more quickly through this because it's not necessarily helping me to translate what I think I need in terms of a layout into a better understanding of that process... Hmm... I need to figure out how to learn this tool... I think Grid is the way to go. I love the idea of having my containers respond to breakpoints in a known way by specifying exactly where it should be located. It reminds me a bit of absolute positioning.
