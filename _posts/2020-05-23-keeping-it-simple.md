title: "Keep It Simple"

I figured out yesterday that although I was trying to keep things simple I was actually complicating my approach by having too many moving pieces. I found myself on several learning curves and needed to limit it to one if possible. I kind of figured out that Vue.js is great but a little complex and that I needed to focus on learning it instead of getting stuck in the weeds trying to implement a project with it. I also realized CodePen was a great way to test out the basics and reinforce fundamental concepts.[^1] I also was curious about the premium features offered and wondered how much I could get done using the free version.[^2]

There are a lot of cool features. I immediately thought this might be a good way to build out prototypes for work with privacy but the flexibility to run demos and share for feedback. I spoke with a colleague and they thought it might be overkill for our needs since we have on prem servers. Yet I realize quickly this can be a trap. Sure I can move code over to our dev resources but I still have to configure them if I want to do anything other than what they are setup to do. Even adding a new site requires that I modify the Apache settings. It's an extra step that I don't have to worry about with CodePen. Lastly, we tried to work on a pen together and ran into some challenges. The Collab Mode would have been nice. I would have paid $8 to have that be a smoother process.[^3]

Anyway... I'm not fully convinced. So I'll continue to use it on my own to see if I can build up a use case to ask for this resource. Yet I still want to keep things simple but not reject effective steps for the sake of simplicity only to end up short sighted. As with most things, finding the right kind of balance is key.
