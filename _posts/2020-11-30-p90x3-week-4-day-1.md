[P90X3](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/programs/p90x3/start-here "If you have 30 minutes a day, you can get totally ripped.") is great! I haven't been as consistent as I'd like to have been over the past three weeks. I've gotten in about 5 days per week... It's been tough balancing life and committing to this routine.

Instead of starting again to do it perfectly, I'm moving forward. I do feel that I've made some progress in my ability to do the routines though I've experienced some regressions in my diet/lifestyle outside of this. I don't even want to admit it but I'm back up to 185! I was close to 170 that first week.

My goal is to finish it. I did Isometrix today for the first time. It was good and tough. Closing my eyes while trying to balance on one foot is really interesting. I've avoided that aspect while in a yoga class and they offer that as a modification for those who want it. I've always been more concerned about falling out of the pose than going deeper. Today I had the chance to try! I'm glad I was kind of forced to do this one...
