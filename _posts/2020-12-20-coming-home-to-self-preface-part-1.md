It's my story. I've got to tell it.

The Primal Wound[^1] and Coming Home to Self[^2] have shaped my understanding of the world so deeply. These posts are an attempt to unpack their significance.

I changed the title a bit to make it more about the book, Coming Home to Self. I do think it's "my story" still but really through the lens of this book... There's likely more to me than this book's topics. However, as this post is really the first one, I already sense some resistance/fear. It's manifesting as a fear that I'll never finish this "project" because I can relate to every line written. Thus logic says if I can relate to every sentence, then I'll expand each sentence to more sentences. Thus a 400 page book will at least double in size. That doesn't seem sustainable. Part of this process will require me to learn how to effectively summarize and expand key points versus regurgitating each sentence.

I'm going to favor speed versus correctness. I did just install a VSCode spell checker extension[^3] to ensure there's some standard adhered to. So let's go...

I'm starting intentionally with the preface just to get my feet wet a bit. Already read through it and want to quote each sentence. Maybe I should pick three... I don't know but I don't want to create a project within a project either. I do realize that fear of being wrong/imperfect, etc. is part of the human experience and for me, enhanced by the wound that I'm about to start describing... So without getting ahead of myself...

This is going to be challenging to put into my own words because she captures these ideas so well...

The Primal Wound[^1] sets the stage for Coming Home to Self[^2]. It's thesis is the separation that occurs from adoption is traumatic for both mother and child and can be considered to be the ultimate form of loss and rejection. This trauma has life long consequences for both and compounded by society's view/delusion of adoption being a positive institution that benefits all. Certainly my experience mirrors this complexity. Especially in the form of the delusion that adoption is good. That I'm wanted and loved. That I have two sets of parents that love me. That I was born after Roe v. Wade and should feel even more lucky that my mother decided to carry me to full term and place me in a home where I would be loved and nurtured in perpetuity. I think you see where I'm going...

Yet what they don't tell you is how this trauma affects all future relationships. They don't say, hey this baby you got, it's going to fear rejection/abandonment it's whole life. You might say, we all fear rejection and abandonment. That's true. So where do we draw the line and say, this is where normal human development stops and adoption trauma begins? The main problem is that the behavior/tactics employed to avoid rejection/abandonment started so early that they evade detection well. The techniques/manuevers used to avoid vulnerability to repeated trauma bewilder and puzzle all involved, including adoptees. What's most interesting for me is that it wasn't until I read The Primal Wound[^1] that I started to see them. I was like holy shit I'm doing all this stuff! I'm not alone in this wokeness! It really is a rebirth of identity.

I've gotta move on and I didn't even make it through one page. Ugh! Oh well... Good stuff for sure.
