It's my story. I've got to tell it.

The Primal Wound[^1] and Coming Home to Self[^2] have shaped my understading of the world so deeply. These posts are an attempt to unpack their significance.

I've had the thought for a long time that I should spend the time to systematically go through these books and take notes on how I relate to the content. Yet so many other things tend to come up. It's hard to know what level of detail to share... Yet I think there's a bit of denial going on that makes it hard to justify the time and effort needed to tackle the subject matter. However, as life moves forward around me, I'm seeing how I still fall back on old patterns of behavior that I wish were no longer a part of my experience. They've even evolved a little, in what seems like an escallation, calling out for my attention.

I hear you wounded Tim! Maybe not loud and clear, but you've got my attention. What do you want? I think you want to know that your safe and loved. How can we get there? To a place where you no longer cry out for help and reassurance at inopportune times. To a place where your cries for attention have been satisfied and life can begin new. I don't fully know.

I have a hard time concentrating on things that don't interest me. Yet the things that interest me seem to be things I've chosen. However, I spend a lot of time bogged down in the mire of complex emotions. This doesn't "interest" me persay, but it does grab my attention. I think it's time to dive deeper. I think a good analogy is that of being really good at something. You need to spend time practicing and doing it. You have to start by getting on the learning curve. Eventually you get better and become proficient.

But here's the thing. What if I experience the opposite? What if I spend a ton of time doing something but don't think I'm very good at it. That's my goal with this work. I want to use the information in these books to become better at life. I want to be good at it. Yet I feel like up to this point I've been barely scraping by. The cost feels high and the approach feels inefficient. Instead of seeking out good information to learn from others, I've been mostly going at it alone. Mainly because I've been hiding. Which as we'll come to find out is really part of the problem.

Here's the plan. I intend to go through Coming Home to Self in a systematic way over the next couple of weeks as much as I can. During this time, my hope is that I'll be able to remain mostly present and not go into a numbing out mode. My hope is that I'll be able to feel safe enough to persevere and walk through the pain by shining light into it. I think the first pass is to read a section and write about it. I don't know how much more I can do. I fear if I don't go at this sort of slow systematic pace that I'll become flooeded and overwhelmed and lose focus on the end goal. To access the pain and feel it knowing that I'm safe and protected.

There are so many additional details that I'd generally like to tease out. Yet I also realize that I need to be careful to not "over analyze" things. I should likely just read and react/respond. I think the explanation will seep out in the details of the posts and form a cohesive narrative on it's own. The overarching theme is to heal through understanding self and unconditionally loving every part discovered.
